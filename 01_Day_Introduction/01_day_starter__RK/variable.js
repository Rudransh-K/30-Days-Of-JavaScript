// const boilingPoint = 100     // water boiling point, temperature in oC
// const PI = 3.14              // geometrical constant

// // Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma

// let name = 'Asabeneh',     //name of a person

// const and let have the same functionality but const cannot be updated
// let variables can be updated but cannot be reassigned using let

// var is the oldest way of declaring variables
// var is global scope or function scope as it is hoisted to be the first thing to be executed and therefore
// will not be an error even if it is used before it is declared in the code

// let and const are block-scoped and can only be used in that block
// the same variable identifiers can be reassigned in another block

//Users cannot change the properties of the const object, but they can change the value of properties of the const object.
